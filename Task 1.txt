Q:- Provide some example of config file separation for dev and prod environments.
Ans:-

A perfect configuration setup should ensure:
:- keys can be read from file AND from environment variable
:-secrets are kept outside committed code
:-config is hierarchical for easier findability

and you have to create config file like this 

var config = {
  production: {
    mongo : {
      Something: '****'
    }
  },
  default: {
    mongo : {
      Something: '****'
    }
  }
}

exports.get = function get(env) {
  return config[env] || config.default;
}

and you hae to require it in your server.js or index.js that file is where you have write port and all stuff like this 

const config = require('./config/config.js').get(process.env.NODE_ENV);
const dbconn = mongoose.createConnection(config.mongo.Something);
